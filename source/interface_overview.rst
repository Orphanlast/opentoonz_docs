Interface Overview
===================================================

The Opentoonz interface is organized into rooms (tabs at the upper right side of the screen), also known as workspaces: each room is a different collection of window panes which are laid and snapped to specific places on the screen. 


Once again, Rooms are tabs located to the upper right of the menu bar. They are showing the content on the current scene that you’re working on. You can rename rooms as well as rearrange them. You can create new rooms. And existing rooms can be deleted as well. So the interface has a high degree of customization. When you create a new room, it’ll be completely empty. To configure it, various window panes can be added one by one. This is a good summary of what you can do with rooms. But now let’s actually describe how you actually DO these things: 

TO ENTER INTO A ROOM: click on one of the tabs to the far upper right of the menu bar. 



TO NAME A ROOM: Double-click the tab and type the name you want to assign to the room.

TO REARRANGE ROOM TABS: Click and drag the Tab to the new position.

TO ADD A NEW ROOM: Right-click on the tab and choose “New Room” from the drop down menu that appears.

TO DELETE A ROOM: First, click on a Room-Tab that’s not the room that you cant to delete, because the current room that you’re IN can’t be deleted while you’re actually in it. Right-click on the room you want to delete, and a drop down menu will appear, choose “Delete Room”.

RETURN ALL THE ROOMS TO THE DEFAULT OPENTOONZ CONFIGURATION: Go to “Windows > Reset to Default Rooms”.

You can customize rooms by snapping Windows into different locations. You can even altering the sizes of these windows, as well as remove various window panes to your liking. If you want to preserve the configuration of your rooms, you can lock them into place by going “Windows > Lock Room Panes”. 

Most Window Panes can be maximized to fill the full interface, and can be added as floating windows. 

TO RESIZE A WINDOW PANE: Click any vertical or horizontal separator and drag it to the new position.
          NOTE: Please keep in mine that some Window panes can’t be resized, such as the toolbar and the level strip.

TO OPEN A WINDOW PANE AS A FLOATING WINDOW: GO to the “Windows” menue and select the Window Pane you want to open.

TO RESIZE A FLOATING WINDOW: Click and drag the border or corner of a window.

TO CLOSE A FLOATING WINDOW OR DIALOG: Click the Close button at the top right of the title bar.



TO SNAP A WINDOW TO A ROOM: 1.) Use the “Windows” menu to open the pane as a floating window. 2.) Click and drag it by the title bar to move it around. Move it to a location when you see a highlighted insertion. Highlighted insertions usually appear when you drag a window to the sides of the screen, and appear to be pink lines displaying how they’re going to snap into place. When you see this, release the window.

REMOVING A WINDOW PANE FROM A ROOM: 1.) Click and drag the title bar of the pane you want to remove to undock it from the room.   2.) Close the floating window. 

MAXIMIZING AND MINIMIZING A WINDOW PANE: Double-click its title bar. Note: Some panes like the toolbar and the level strip have some fixed size, therefore they cannot be maximized. 

TO LOCK/UNLOCK ROOM CONFIGURATION:  You can activate or deactivate the locking function to your customized rooms, just go “Windows > Lock Room Panes”. In the “Windows” menu, there’s a list of Window Panes that you can use to build rooms. Once clicked on, they’ll open as floating windows.

BATCH SERVERS: The Batch Servers window allows you to process the batch list by using the render farm, and contains information about the list of server (rendering) nodes defined for the farm. If you need more information on this topic, go to “Using the OpenToonz Farm” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “Monitoring the Server Nodes” (If that section is currently empty, feel free to copy and paste the information from the Toonz Harlequin Guide located here: http://www.toonz.com/cgi-shl/download/71H/Toonz%20Harlequin%2071%20User%20Guide.pdf but please edit the content so that it matches the Opentoonz interface. 

COLOR MODEL:  The color model viewer displays the image, or animation level, you loaded as reference to paint the current animation level. If you need more information go to “Painting Animation Levels” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “Color Model”.

FILE BROWSER: The file browser allows you to load and save files, and to access projects. On the left there is a file tree with some main folders containing material stored on your computer: My Computer, Network, My Documents, History, Library and Projects. You can open folders and sub-folders in order to retrieve files that are displayed in the area on the right. If you need more information, go to “Managing Projects” and you might also want to check go to “Working in Xsheet” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “Using the File Browser”.

FLIPBOOK: The flipbook can display animation levels, clips or sequences of images. For instance, it can be used to check levels before loading them, or to control a rendered sequence. If you need more information, go to “Rendering the Animation” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “Using the Flipbook”.

FUNCTION EDITOR: The function editor maps objects and FX transformations with key values and related interpolations by using function curves or numerical columns. It is divided into two sections: on the left there is the stage and FX tree, and on the right the area where the curves and the numerical columns can be displayed. If you need more information, go to “Editing Curves and Numerical Columns” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “Using the Function Editor”.

LEVEL STRIP:  The level strip displays the sequence of drawings belonging to the level currently selected in the xsheet. It helps you to edit the sequence of drawings and to see all the drawings of the current level, even if those drawings are not exposed in the xsheet. If you need more information, go to “Level Strip” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “Editing Animation Levels”.

MESSAGE CENTER: The message center displays a list of messages OpenToonz is sending to the user. You can set filters on the messages showed in the window using the appropriate radio buttons, or you can clear completely the list pressing the Clear button.

PALLETE: The Pallete displays something similar to swatches, but for most of the various level types in Opentoonz, they have more functionality than just generic swatches. There are no “Swatches” in Opentoonz, instead they’re called “Styles”. And the Pallet displays the styles for the current level. Or in some cases it can display the styles defined for a previously selected level. If you need more information, go to “Managing Palettes and Styles” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “The Palette Window”.

SCENE CAST: The scene cast Window Pane lets you control the files loaded in the scene, save them and load new ones. It can be organized in folders and sub-folders. If you need more information, go to “Working in Xsheet” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “Using the Scene Cast”.

SCHEMATIC: The schematic has two different modes. There’s the Stage Schematic mode. And there’s the FX Schematic Mode. Both have a node interface. First, let’s discuss the Stage Schematic mode where its nodes display all the objects defined in a scene, such as columns, pegbars, cameras, the table and motion paths, and allows you to manage the way they are linked to each other. Where as, the FX schematic allows you to apply special FX to the content of xsheet columns, and you can manage the way they are applied. All the columns and FX are displayed as nodes that can be connected in order to set the way FX affect the scene content. If you need more information, go to “Creating Movements ” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “Using the Stage Schematic”, also see “Applying Special FX” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “Using the FX Schematic”

VIEWER: The viewer is the work area where you can draw images and also see the final result of your compositing with the Preview Mode. It is endless and you can scroll, zoom in, zoom out rotate it, flip it vertically and horizontally to the way you prefer. It has different modes of visualization which you can choose when suitable, such as viewing your animation in the “3D View” or in the “Preview Mode”. If you need more information, go to “Drawing Animation Levels ” in the Opentoonz User Manual and see “Using the Work Area” and also be sure to go to “Rendering the Animation” and see “Previewing the Animation”. 

XSHEET: The xsheet allows you to manage the scene content. It is organized in columns, and each column is a different layer in the stacking order. And the columns are divided into cells, which are interchangeably called “Frames”. On each cell, you can place animation levels, clips, images, audio files, note levels, notes, or other xsheets. A frame is only refrerered to as a “Level” if it happens to have a level on it. Each column has its own header containing information about its content. The column on the far left displays the frame number, with a cursor placed on the current frame. The headers area and the frame column are always visible, even when scrolling the xsheet area; in this way it's easier to understand how the scene is built. Frames are rendered reading images from left to right in each cell row. If you need more information, go to “Working in Xsheet” in the Opentoonz User Manual.




Customizing the Interface Appearance
The appearance of the OpenToonz interface can be customized to suit any production need by choosing a specific language and interface style. OpentToonz allows you to choose a specific language for the software interface, including menus, commands, tooltips, and on-screen messages. 

(The following is content that the editor of this page does not have expertise on. It is a direct quote of the Toonz Harlequin Guide). The interface style is defined by means of a QSS file, whose concepts, terminology, and syntax are inspired by CSS files (HTML Cascading Style Sheets). The QSS files also refers to a set of PNG images that are used to create interface widgets. These files are stored in a folder named as the QSS file, and located in the Program Files\Toonz 7.0 \qss folder on Windows and Applications/Toonz 7.0 /qss folder on Macintosh. Note: The QSS file for Macintosh is named with the _mac suffix. The QSS file can be edited with any text editor software, e.g. Notepad or TextEdit; the PNG images with any image editor software. Editing the QSS file requires some skill in CSS language, but some changes like colors of pane elements, can be easily done by expressing them with red, green and blue values. Note: The QSS files defining the colors and the images used in the Toonz interface have to be written according to a specific syntax, otherwise Toonz interface will not be displayed properly. If you decide to edit a QSS file, make a backup 

To choose the interface style: 
1.) Choose File > Preferences > Interface.
2.) In the Language option menu choose the language you want to use in the interface.
3.) Restart OpenToonz to have the interface in the selected language.

To choose the interface style: 
1.) Choose File > Preferences > Interface.
2.) In the Style option menu choose the style to be applied to the interface.

To create a new style: 
1.) Navigate to Program Files\Toonz 7.0 \qss folder on Windows and Applications/Toonz 7.0 /qss folder on Macintosh.
2.) Duplicate one of the already existing style folder.
3.) Rename the folder and the QSS files inside it with the name you want to assign to the style.
4.) Edit the QSS file and the PNG images contained in the new folder. Note: The new style will be available in the Preferences dialog the next time you run Toonz. To edit style QSS file: Open and edit with a text editor software (e.g. Notepad or TextEdit) the QSS files available in the style folder. To edit style images: Open and edit with an image editor software the PNG files available in the style folder.
